What Do We Learn in This Course

We learn Deep Learning, that simple!

The main focus of the course is on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) which are the main components in Deep Learning. We get familiarized with ANNs in three gradual steps:

    Step 1: We start with understanding the basics of machine learning. This is mainly because, the course does not require you to have prior lectures in machine learning. If you already had one, that would be no problem at all! We are not going to study too much of those theories, and probably you still find this introductory part informative. We mainly learn (1) what is the main problem in machine learning? (2) what is Dep Learning and why we do it? (3) what are ANNs and why they work? and (4) where do we use ANNs?
    Step 2: Once we learned the basics, we start with fundamental approaches to build an ANN; namely, we learn the Feedforward NNs (FNNs), Convolutional NNs(CNNs) and recurrent NNs (RNNs). A large part of course will be dealing with these architectures, their training and implementation. For each architecture, we learn how to train them using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and how to use the Backpropagation algorithm to implement SGD. We further learn how to prepare data before we give it to the NN. As you may expect, there are a ton of challenges arising when we are training and implementing these architectures. We will go through all of them at our own pace, understand the theory behind the scenes and learn the baseline approach to solve them
    Step 3: At this point, we are rather expert in Deep Learning. So, we take a step further and study some advanced topics, such as Sequence-to-Sequence Models and Auto-Encoders. We will see how easily we could follow these topics using the knowledge we built in the first two steps.

The detailed syllabus of the course can be found at the Syllabus page of the course.
Programming in Python

Throughout the course, we will use Pyhton as the main programming language to implement ANNs, solve the assignments, and so the final project. If you have some experience in Python that would be a plus; however, if not, only a quick catch-up of the basic syntax would be enough. We will study required tools in Tutorials. There are some packages that we will get to know them, such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch and Pandas; the most important of them is PyTorch is the key library that not only we but many professionals use for Deep Learning.

Assignments


Midterm Exam

Let's call it midterm, but to be fair it would be a theory-side-of-the-course exam!

Final Project

Last but not the least, there will be a final project.
