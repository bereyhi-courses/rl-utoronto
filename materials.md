## Book

There is indeed no single textbook for this course, and we use various resources in the course. The following textbooks have covered the key notions in the course. 

* [[GYC] Goodfellow, Ian, et al. _Deep Learning._ MIT Press, 2016.](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
* [[BB] Bishop, Christopher M., and Hugh Bishop. _Deep Learning: Foundations and Concepts._ Springer Nature, 2023.](https://www.bishopbook.com/)
* [[Ag] C. Aggarwal. _Neural Networks and Deep Learning._ Springer, 2018.](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-94463-0)

The following textbooks are also good resources for __practicing hands-on skills.__ Note that we are __not__ simply learning to implement only! We study the fundamentals of deep learning. Of course, we try to get our hands dirty as well and learn how to do implementation.
