## Lecture Notes
The lecture notes are uploaded through the semester. For each chapter, the notes are provided section by section. 
### Chapter 0: Course Overview and Logistics
* [Handouts]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Notes/CH0/CH0.pdf): All Sections included in a single file

### Chapter 1: RL Framework
* [Section 1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Notes/CH1/CH1_Sec1.pdf): Multi-armed Bandit
* [Section 2]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Notes/CH1/CH1_Sec2.pdf): RL PRoblem: _Definitions and Basics_
* [Section 3]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Notes/CH1/CH1_Sec3.pdf): Playing in RL Framework
* [Section 4]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Notes/CH1/CH1_Sec4.pdf): Our First Game



<!-- ## Tutorial Notebooks -->
<!-- The tutorial notebooks can be accessed below.
* [Tutorial 1]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Tutorials/Tutorial_1.ipynb): PyTorch Overview, Batch Training, Embedding, and Tokenization, by __Amir Hossein Mobasheri__ -->


## Book

Most of the contents covered in the first two parts of course can be further read in

* [[SB] Sutton, R., and Barto, A. _Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction,_ 2nd Edition, MIT Press, 2018](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html)

The following old preprint is also a good summary of important RL algorithms

* [[CS] Csaba Szepesvari, _Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning_ (2009)](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/papers/RLAlgsInMDPs.pdf)

Most materials in the third part, i.e., deep RL, are collected from research papers. The following textbook is also good resources for __practicing hands-on skills.__

* [Maxim Lapan. _Deep Reinforcement Learning Hands-On._ O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2020.](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-reinforcement-learning/9781838826994/)
