  <h2><strong>Code of Honor</strong></h2>
  Assignments are designed to enhance your understanding and skills, constituting a significant portion of your final assessment. They must be completed <strong>individually,</strong> as engaging in any form of academic dishonesty violates the principles of the Code of Honor. If you encounter any challenges while solving the assignments, please contact the instructional team for guidance.
